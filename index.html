     <h3> SPYCE :  Robot Kitchen</h3>
     <p>The Robotic Kitchen is a automatic kitchen where it can serve salads and warm bowls of foods.</p>
     <p>Depending on the food you choose, The bowl goes through a series of conveyer belts under dispensers.</p>
     <p>While going through the conveyer belt, The dispensers dispense out food based on the portions it was set to.</p>
     <p>For warm bowls of foods, the bowl goes through heated steamers and planchas for protein.</p>
     <p>Does not come with no cons, The kitchen canâ€™t keep up with high demand and is very limited on the choices of foods.</p>

         <h3>Order Kiosk</h3>
         <p>Order Kiosk's are alternatives for ordering food in the store. Instead of waiting on a line you can order on a kiosk.</p>
         <p>It is most commonly found in most fast food places like Mc Donalds.</p>
         <p>Kiosk's are great for efficiency of ordering since it's technically taking more orders in.</p>
         <p>More orders also means more work on the workers, This is a con of Order Kiosks.</p>

         <h3> Automated Delivery Car</h3>
         <p>The Automated Delivery Car can hold up to 20 pounds of food and make a 4 mile round trip</p>
         <p>The car can't be stolen from because it has a lock, the only way of opening this lock is when the client gets a link from the app.</p>
         <p>The car has a 360 view of it's surroundings, allowing it to go around obstacles and walk through crosswalks safely.</p>
         <p>Incase it gets stolen, There is a tracker on the car for insurance, But through numerous testing there it was never stolen.</p>
         <p>The car is still in development and testing and so far it can only travel short distances, But this innovation in itself is an amazing technological feat.</p>

           <h3 class="overviewmargin"> My Innovative Idea</h3>
           <p class="fornav">The innovations today are pretty advanced, it goes from something more simple like a Kiosk, to complicated technology.</p>
           <p>like a automated delivery car The idea behind my innovation is being able to instantly order some at the counter.</p>
           <p>The neccesities to do this is to just have the app on a phone.To get started you first have to put what you want</p>
           <p>on the phone and a numerical sequence or barcode will be given to you. You can then go up to a counter and instantly</p>
           <p>order with a scan of some sort, This can allow more efficiency in taking orders. After the first time ordering, </p>
           <p>you can now instatly re-order what you did previously. There is something similar to this, but it requires facial </p>
           <p>recognition and not everyone is comfortable with having their face scanned.</p>
